##### Project Details


•	Description

o	For this project we will be creating the game of “Go Fish” as an app, and we are making it unique by making the game voice-activated by using Android Studio's voice recognition.

o	The user will be playing against a computer player.

o	The main feature is the voice activated component to the game, however we are also making the game itself from scratch

o	Another main component to this game is that we would extend the applicability of the game to different themes by including kids categories as well (main themes: original game, animals, fruits, & colors)

o	The specific themes may be subject to change but we all agree that in the long run this app should have 1 original theme and 3 themes designated for kids

•	Value

o	The unique value of this game lies within the voice-activated component

o	This is useful to play the game hands-free, and also has potential to improve speech and communication skills in certain audiences such as kids

o	An additional value to this app is that it has an educational component for children audiences (namely with the 3 themes seen above such as food and colors). This will help kids learn about different about objects while also practicing communication skills


##### Version Control

•	https://github.com/isobonja/CS-321-Project.git

•	We are using a GitHub Repository for now, but it is on private so we can add Dr. S and GTA’s, or change visibility (whatever is preferred and adheres with honor code)
